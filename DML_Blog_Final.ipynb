(2016) to get the causal estimand of interest: average treatment effect (ATE) $\\ \\eta_0 $ using Neyman orthogonality and cross-fitting. For observational data, we will estimate the causal relationship between the eligibility and participation in the 401(k) and its effect on net financial assets; as well to apply it to other datasets, to find the effect of the Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus on the unemployment duration and the effect of smoking on medical costs. As proposed by Chernozhukov’s Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML) framework, we will estimate the causal effects of binary treatments on an outcome, the regression parameter in a partially linear regression model. With use of machine learning (ML) methods to estimate the nuisance parameters $\\ \\eta_0 $ : the dependency of the confounding factors (controls) with respect to the outcome and the treatment assignment.\n",

    "## 1) Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "People in the fields of econometrics, epidemiology, philosophy, just to name a few, have been interested into modelling causality: drawing conclusion through statistical analyses from associations between measurements. Although getting inferences from these statistical analyses could be tricky since the association (correlation) doesn’t imply causation. The word “causation” started to appear in settings of randomized experiments by Neyman (1923). Fisher (1935) stressed the importance of randomization as the basis for inference. Rubin (1974) takes it to a non-random assignment mechanism which could apply not only to experimental data, but also observational. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "As computational power increased, innovations in statistical inference followed. New statistical approaches were developed and now these robust models could handle big sets of data with an extensive number of semi-parametric covariates:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In 2016, Victor Chernozhukov et al. introduced the “Double/ Debiased Machine Learning for Treatment and Structural Parameters” to solve the classic semiparametric problem of inference on a low parameter $\\ \\theta_0 $ in the presence of a high-dimensional nuisance parameter $\\ \\eta_0 $. A nuisance parameter represents an intermediate step for computing the parameter of interest. In this case, the treatment effect on a certain variable denoted by $\\ \\theta_0 $ is of interest. Victor Chernozhukov et al. estimate the nuisance parameters through machine learning estimators.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Only machine learning models are applicable, which able to handle high dimensional cases, meaning that the entropy of the parameter space is increasing based on the sample size in a sufficiently small way (traditional framework). The following predictors are employed: Random Forest, Lasso, Ridge, Deep Neural Networks, Boosted Trees, and ensemble models based on at least one of them. This approach reduces the effect of easily overfitting and find a suitable trade-off between regularization and bias. By cross-fitting and using Neyman-orthogonal moment functions/ score functions Double/ Debiased Machine Learning reduces the bias, to get a closer estimate for the treatment effect $\\ \\theta_0 $. Neyman-orthogonal functions have a lower sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters while estimating treatment effects $\\ \\theta_0 $.\n",

Therefore, the blog is structured as followed: In section 2) we will make reference to developments in the machine learning field for average treatment estimation purposes. Section 3) provides a deeper insight into DML. In section 4) contains the empirical test of our code and interpretation of results. \n",

    "## 2) Literature Review\n",
    "For unconfounded assignment of the treatment effects there are a number of approaches that have been used through the development of statistical inference. Using the inverse of nonparametric estimates of the propensity scores for treatment effect estimations was an idea introduced by Hirano, Keisuke, et al. (2003). Elizabeth Stuart (2010) considered a wide range of matching methods to best compare the treatment effect between groups with covariates in common for an unbiased comparison. Knaus, et. al. (2018) used machine learning to simulate data generation processes (DGPs).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\tThe machine learning estimators have been used for the estimation of heterogenous causal effects across different disciplines. The approaches with the different machine leraning methods are: regression trees by Su, et. al. (2009), random forests by Wagner and Athey (2018), lasso by  Qian and Murphy (2011), support vector machines by Imai and Ratkovic (2013),  boosting by Powers, et. al. (2018), neural networks by Johansson, F., et. al. (2016).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\tSpecifically focused in developments of the Double Machine Learning, we can find an applied study by Knaus (2018): A Double Machine Learning Approach to Estimate the Effects of Musical Practice on Student’s Skills. He used the dataset of the German National Economic Panel Study (NEPS) Blossfeld and von Maurice (2011).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\tChernozhukov et al (2016) also provided extensions to the model that are not going t be implemented by us. They proposed using instrumental variables (IV) in the partially linear model. He also estimates the average treatment effect on the treated (ATTE) and the local average treatment effects (LATE).\n"

    "The purpose for the average treatment effect is to find the impact of participating in the 401 (k) plan with respect to the net financial assets Y. 401(k) plan denotes a pension account in the United States. Participants pay their contributions based on their income. Not each firm is offering this kind of retirement and the participation is free. The idea beyond this dataset is, that when the 401(k) plan program started, people would make job decisions not based on the retirement offers, hence, on the income or other job criteria. The main problem of the experimental dataset is that it lacks random assignment. To partial that out and consider the data as exogenous there must be done some conditioning on income and other variables related to job choice that might have an association with whether the firm has the 401 (K) plan available, based on  the argument of Poterba et. al. (1994). The dataset based on the Survey of Income and Program Participation of 1991.

    "We try to find the effect of the unemployment bonus on unemployment duration. This dataset was used in the original paper of Chernozhukov et al (2016). The Pennsylvania Reemployment Bonus experiment dataset contains observation of testing the incentive effects of alternative compensation schemes for unemployment insurance by the US Department of Labor in the 1980’s which was previously analyzed by Bilias (2000) and Bilias and Koenker (2002). Five groups of unemployed persons were defined. One control group, which still get treated by the standard rules of unemployment insurance, and four treated groups, all randomly assigned. Treated persons got a cash bonus, if they got hired. The cash bonus differed by some criteria. The given dataset only contains persons, who get treated by the treatment group 4. This group received a high bonus amount, but they were forced to take part in a longer qualification period. We only consider the 4th group and the control, to have a binary treatment variable D. Participants could take part in special Workshops.  The outcome variable tries to catch the effect of this support on the duration of the unemployment period, and its vector of covariates includes age, gender, race, number of dependents, location, type of occupation, etc. \n",

    "Our approach performed better on this data set. Our results are close to the of the original paper. Only small differences between the median and mean refer a low number of outliers and better predictions. In this scenario the decision trees and neural network seem to perform best by providing results close to the original papers. Parameter tuning should increase performance and accuracy. This data set is larger than the 401(k) plan data set, that could cause the better performance.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "This blog post gave a fast introduction into the Double machine learning approach. We explained the basic idea and refer for further readings to the original paper of Victor Chernozhukov et al. and implemented parts of the approach in Python. By applying the code on the different data sets we evaluated our work. The next steps on this work would be the implementation of the DML2 algorithm and the extends named in the paper. The apllying of the algorithms on other data sets and the extension with other machine learning models. Also we would use parameter tuning for enlarging accuracy. \n",
